            <li>"<strong>Person of Interest / POI</strong>" is a crime TV series produced by CBS TV in the United States. Jonathan Nolan and JJ Abrams jointly created the plot structure. It tells the story of a predecessor CIA agent who presumed to die and a mysterious billionaire to use a unique approach to stop the crime. The show premiered on September 22, 2011. The second season will be broadcast from September 28, 2012. The third season will be broadcast on September 24, 2013. CBS announced the renewal of the fourth quarter in May 2014, and the fourth season will begin on Wednesday, September 24, 2014.</li>
            <li>Software genius Finch invented a program to identify criminals who are likely to commit violent crime by observing existing patterns. He hired a former US Air Force Special Forces member who was presumed to have died and former CIA agent Reese, who used the country. The level of monitoring technology, with Reese's expertise and Finch's infinite wealth, began "extra-legal enforcement" in an effort to stop it before it happened. Reese's actions caught the attention of the New York City Police Department, including police detectives Carter and Fusco.</li>
            <li>In the face of countless criminal investigations, Reese and Finch found that the key to changing everything is finding the right people, the right information and the right time.</li>
